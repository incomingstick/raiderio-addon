# RaiderIO

Provides you with an easy way to look at someones Mythic+ Score in-game.

Simply hover over a player with your mouse, your guild roster, or even the Group Finder list where you see queued people; if they have a score you'll see it on their tooltip.

# Getting started

The easiest way is to use the Twitch client over at Curse to get your addon up-to-date. Install it, then start your game. The next step is to then open the addons dialog and enable the region and faction you wish to be able to lookup in-game. You need to load the correct region, and the factions you wish to be able to lookup.

# Updates

We'll upload nightly builds with updated databases over players and their scores. Simply use the Twitch client to update the addon, and you'll update the scores as well.
