# Raider.IO Mythic Plus

## Overview

This is a companion addon to go along with the Raid and Mythic+ Rankings site, Raider.IO: https://raider.io. With this addon installed, you'll gain access to an easy way to view the Mythic Keystone scores and activity for players-- all without leaving the game!

Simply hover over a player with your mouse, your guild roster, or even the Group Finder list where you see queued people; if they meet the minimum qualifications then you'll see their score and best run in the tooltip.

Additionally, you can right-click players from the standard target unit frame to `Copy Raider.IO URL` and then easily look up their full profile on the site. With this functionality you can directly paste these URLs anywhere on Raider.IO to navigate to that player's profile page.

If you have run into any problems, check out our FAQ at https://raider.io/faq, or join us on Discord at: https://discord.gg/jxpbvDy -- we always have people around willing to help.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to download the Twitch Desktop App at: https://app.twitch.tv/download, and then search for the "Raider.IO Mythic Plus" addon and install it.

Once installed you can load into the game and you will start seeing Scores and Best Runs on players around you. This AddOn works by storing a snapshot of character data from Raider.IO and then using that to populate information on qualified players. To qualify for inclusion in the daily snapshot, players must meet this criteria:

- Have earned at least 500 points in the current or previous Mythic+ season
- Have logged in to the game within the past 30 days

**Remember**: We update the addon with the latest scores and top runs **every day**. Update regularly to ensure you are seeing the freshest information. _Using the Twitch Client you can enable Automatic Updates for the addon to make this process a breeze_.

## Detailed Usage

Our intent with this AddOn is to provide an easy way for people to get some information at a glance when forming groups. There is no substitute for talking with your fellow players, so be a pal and listen if an applicant whispers you. These are the fields we show, and when we show them:

- `Raider.IO M+ Score`: This is the overall score for the player in the current season
- `Best Run`: This will indicate the Mythic+ level for the player's best scoring run, along with the specific dungeon. Note: Sometimes, players on high pop servers may show a value of `(KSM)`, `(KSC)`, or `(KSI)`. This  means that we have validated via achievement criteria that they have completed and **timed** a +15, +10, or +5 **within the current season**.
- `Best For Dungeon`: You'll see this line when using LFD to form or join a Keystone group. This will show the Mythic+ level of the player's best scoring run for the chosen dungeon. Note: If someone's highest run is only visible from KSM/KSC/KSI, they may have run any dungeon to earn that, but we will not know which specific dungeon they cleared.
- `Previous Season Score`: If the player's recorded score for the previous Mythic+ season was greater than their score in the current Mythic+ season, then we will show their Previous Season Score. A player's score from a previous season is a good indicator of _at least_ what they'll be able to do in the current season.
- `Main's Score`: This indicates a player's score on the Main they have chosen on Raider.IO. This will only show if the Main's Score is greater than the current character's score. If someone has a good score on their main, then much of their prior experience will help them perform better in dungeons while on their alt.
- `DPS Score`, `Tank Score`, `Healer Score`: These are the role-specific scores for the player in the current season. These are only shown if greater than zero. By default, role scores are not shown, and you must hold down a modifier key (e.g. alt) to show them. If desired, you can make it so Role scores always show by turning on the option *Always Show Role Scores*.

## Configuring the AddOn

Our recommended settings are enabled by default, but we've provided several options to customize how and where the tooltips might show while in-game. Type ``/raiderio`` to open the Raider.IO options frame. Alternatively, you can also find a shortcut in the ``Interface > AddOn`` settings frame.

Here you can easily enable or disable various features, including whether to show scores from each faction, and various tooltip customization options.

_Remember to click Save to save the changes, or Cancel to abort and close the dialog._

## Score Color Tiers

Scores map to a specific color based on their range. We've followed the standard WoW quality colors, but added additional gradients between the base values to provide more brackets to ascend through. See the full tiers here:

## Developer API

We love our fellow developers! We wanted to provide anyone in the community a simple way to tap into the scores that are a part of this addon. Addon developers can do this by utilizing the ``RaiderIO`` table to access certain APIs we provide.

Use this function to retrieve a profile for a specific unit, or by using a name and realm, and optionally provide a faction (1 for Alliance, 2 for Horde) for a quicker lookup.

### RaiderIO.GetScore

Retrieve Mythic+ Scores for a given unit/player with any of these methods:

```
RaiderIO.GetScore(unit)
RaiderIO.GetScore("Name-Realm"[, nil, 1|2])
RaiderIO.GetScore("Name", "Realm"[, 1|2])
```

The following table is returned if there are results for the given player, otherwise nil:

```
{
  region = "us" | "eu" | "kr" | "tw",
  faction = 1|2,
  date = "2001-12-31T12:00:00Z",
  season = "Season 7.2.5",
  prevSeason = "Season 7.2.0",
  name = "Name",
  realm = "Realm",
  allScore = number,
  prevAllScore = number,
  tankScore = number,
  healScore = number,
  dpsScore = number,
  isTank = boolean,
  isHealer = boolean,
  isDPS = boolean,
  numRoles = number
}
```

### RaiderIO.GetScoreColor

Retrieve the color to use when rendering the given score value.

``RaiderIO.GetScoreColor(number)``

This will return a tuple of r/g/b values in the 0-1 range:

```
r, g, b
```
